Car Game 
I developed this game to strengthen my javascript skills
This game includes featues such as :
User Controls: Players can control the car using keyboard inputs (arrow keys).
Collision Detection: The game detects collisions with other cars and ends the game when a collision occurs.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score.
